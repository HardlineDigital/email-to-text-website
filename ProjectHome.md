Requirements:
Web server running PHP.
Access to an SMTP outbound server that does not require authentication. (usually through your ISP or in house email provider.)

I took the code from a simple web contact email form and modified it to send text messages.
It can be configured for group messaging or single recipient.
It has a built in time-stamp for verification. I have it configured to send an email to truck drivers but it also copies supervisors and other dispatchers for oversight.
